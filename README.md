## About

Imagine a very detailed yet brief summary of this coode

## 🚴 Usage

### 🛠️ Build

Since I don't want to use a bundler run:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

### 🔬 Test in Headless Browsers with `wasm-pack test`

```bash
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

## 🔋 Batteries Included

  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
